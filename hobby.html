              I like unique keyboards such as

              and retro keyboards. I use HHKB for my research work, and sometimes I use a

              I built a device using Arduino that converts signals from a

            <h2>Meditation</h2>
            <p>
              I became interested in meditation from a neuroscience perspective and participated in a week-long retreat at a temple, where I was prohibited from using my smartphone, reading books, and even talking.
              Meditation continues to help improve my quality of life.

            <h2>Crossdressing</h2>
            <p>
              I put on makeup, wear a wig, and go out. It's fascinating to experience the gap between how I see myself and how others see me.
              I've been sometimes mistaken for a woman because my Twitter icons (<a href="https://x.com/towbish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@towbish</a> and
              <a href="https://x.com/NobashiSaki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@NobashiSaki</a>) are photos of me crossdressed.

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              I'm especially interested in the philosophy of science and philosophy of mind.
              I believe that "doing philosophy" doesn't necessarily involve "reading philosophy books."
              I see reading such books as a shortcut to doing philosophy.

            <h2>Anime (JP/EN)</h2>
            <p>
              I enjoy watching anime in both Japanese and English.
              I started watching dubbed versions as part of my English studies, but I got hooked by how beautiful the voices and pronunciation are.
              <br/>
              Just to clarify—I'm often misunderstood on this—I legally watch anime by paying for international streaming services.
              <br/>
              There was a time when I listened to the English dub of the infamous
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Melancholy_of_Haruhi_Suzumiya_episodes#Season_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Endless Eight</a> on loop during experiments.
              As I got to the point where I could tell which episode it was by sound alone, my listening and speaking improved dramatically.
              I now recommend the "Endless Endless Eight" method to my Japanese friends struggling with learning English.
              <br/>
              My favorite series include *Puella Magi Madoka Magica*, *STEINS;GATE* (including SG0), *Attack on Titan*, and *PSYCHO-PASS*.
              I haven't kept up with most series released after 2020, so if you know of any dark and compelling shows, I'd love to hear your recommendations.

            <h2>Painfully Tough Games</h2>
            <p>
              I enjoy tough games that drain your body, mind, and time—or playing with severe self-imposed restrictions.
              <br/>
              I've completed all titles and collected every medal in *MHP2G*, and also collected every item and recruited every monster in *Dragon Quest V*.
              Lately, I've been diving into an ancient MMORPG. It's a never-ending nightmare...awesome!

              are forms of gambling unique to Japan. Statisticians often like gambling.
